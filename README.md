# python-raycaster

I've always wanted to build one of these, so I decided to try building one based on 
tinyraycaster (https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraycaster). However, I'm not well versed 
in C++, and didn't want to distract myself learning the language instead of the 
internals of a raycaster, so I decided to convert ssloy's code to Python as I went. 
My commits will (initially at least) follow ssloy's.  

For performance and ease of image processing, I decided to use pygame.
