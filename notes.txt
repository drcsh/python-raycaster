Todo:
- Player attacks
-- Basic version: press button and generate bullet just infront of player location, have bullet hit enemies and decrease their HP
-- Adv version: first pass at a HUD.
- Enemy attacks
-- Animation is now possible. Just need to add animations and make them take HP off the player.
- Map square which ends the level and moves the player to the next one
- Main menu
- Saving the game (serialise/unserialise GameState).

Bugs:

* Wall collision bug:
If you run into walls at certain angles you can see through the walls. Need to extend the "no entry" range of the wall.

* Enemy Rendering problem:
There's something a bit off about where the enemies are located on the screen. Moving the gargoyle to be on the same
x as the player, it's centre point should be right in the middle of the screen, however it's being calculated as slightly
to the right (279.3687705734454 instead of 256~). This problem is even worse in ssloy's original code where you can see
that the enemies are being rendered a varying amount off to the right of their correct location.

I had a look at his bugfixed code but moving around the operations as he's done doesn't fix the problem.
