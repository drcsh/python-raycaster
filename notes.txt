Todo:
- Better HUD
- Weapon cooldowns!
- Weapons on screen
- Map square which ends the level and moves the player to the next one
- Main menu
- Saving the game (serialise/unserialise LevelManager).

Further architecture improvements:
- The classes in the entities folder have a lot of dependencies up and down the tree, it would be best
to resolve this. At first glance it feels like something like "enemy" should be a first class entity with
no external dependencies, but another way of looking at this is that the first class entity is actually
animated_object, and enemy is a set of parameters which plug into it and should ultimately be loaded 
from file. 


Bugs:

* Wall collision bug:
If you run into walls at certain angles you can see through the walls. Need to extend the "no entry" range of the wall.

* Enemy Rendering problem:
There's something a bit off about where the enemies are located on the screen. Moving the gargoyle to be on the same
x as the player, it's centre point should be right in the middle of the screen, however it's being calculated as slightly
to the right (279.3687705734454 instead of 256~). This problem is even worse in ssloy's original code where you can see
that the enemies are being rendered a varying amount off to the right of their correct location.

I had a look at his bugfixed code but moving around the operations as he's done doesn't fix the problem.
