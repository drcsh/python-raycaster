    GameState tracks the current level and all GameObjects in the level, as well
    as the player. GameState provides some easy methods for triggering behaviours
    of GameObjects tracked on it, but otherwise has no behaviour of its own.

    To higher level entities (for handling inputs and rendering), GameState keeps track of
    what's going on and provides utility functions to effect the whole level, e.g. calling the
    Behaviours upon all enemies in the level.

    Lower level entities (e.g. enemies) shouldn't really reach 'up' into the GameState, they should be acted upon from
    'above'.

    Todo: provide save and load functionality!
